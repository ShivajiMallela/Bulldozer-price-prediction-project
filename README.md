# Bulldozer Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the prices of bulldozers using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers). 

## Introduction

Predicting the price of heavy equipment like bulldozers is essential for various industries, including construction and mining. This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate the price of bulldozers based on various attributes such as year, manufacturer, and usage metrics. The goal is to assist buyers, sellers, and manufacturers in making informed decisions about bulldozer transactions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Blue Book for Bulldozers dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers) from Kaggle. It contains historical sale prices and various attributes of bulldozers, including:

1. Model type
2. Year of manufacturing
3. Size and dimensions
4. Sale date
5. Usage metrics (e.g., hours worked)
6. Previous sale information
7. Auction information

## Model

The project involves the following main steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the relationships between features and the target variable, identifying patterns, and gaining insights into the data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection**: Evaluating and selecting the best-performing machine learning algorithms for regression tasks.
5. **Model Training**: Training the selected models on the preprocessed data.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the hyperparameters of the models to further improve performance.
8. **Prediction**: Making predictions on new bulldozer data to estimate their prices.
